# QuantCraft Goals

## Primary Objective
Develop institutional-level quant research, trading, and risk engineering skill
capable of supporting autonomous and prop-safe systems (HoldIQ).

## Success Criteria
- Can design, implement, and reject strategies correctly
- Can explain when math assumptions fail
- Can quantify risk, not just returns
- Can survive realistic execution and regime shifts

## Non-Goals
- Shallow backtest optimization
- Black-box modeling without diagnostics
- Overfitting disguised as intelligence

# Phase 0 · Week 1 · Day 1
## Numerical Reality & Quant Thinking

### Objective
Understand why numerical precision, not formulas, kills real systems.

---

## Theory Focus
- Floating point representation (IEEE intuition)
- Precision vs accuracy
- Why subtraction is dangerous
- Catastrophic cancellation

---

## Key Concepts
- Machine numbers are not real numbers
- Errors compound multiplicatively
- Stability > correctness

---

## Experiments
- Compute variance using:
  - naive formula
  - two-pass formula
- Test with:
  - very large numbers
  - very small deltas

---

## Observations
-

## Failures Observed
- #numerical

---

## Risk Implications
Why small numerical errors can:
- distort risk estimates
- inflate Sharpe
- hide tail risk

---

## Execution Reality
Would this error worsen under:
- leverage?
- high turnover?
- volatile regimes?

---

## Decision
- Proceed / Revise / Rethink

---

## Notes
If a system cannot survive floating-point reality, it cannot survive markets.

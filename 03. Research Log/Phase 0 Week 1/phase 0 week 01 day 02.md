# Phase 0 · Week 1 · Day 2
## Asymptotics, Approximations & Error

### Objective
Learn how quants reason when exact answers do not exist.

---

## Theory Focus
- Big-O vs constants
- Taylor expansions
- Approximation domains
- Error bounds

---

## Key Concepts
- All models are approximations
- Know *where* they fail
- Error growth matters more than elegance

---

## Experiments
- Implement:
  - exp(x) approximation
  - log(1+x) approximation
- Compare error across ranges

---

## Observations
- 
- 

---

## Failures Observed
- #assumption
- 

---

## Risk Implications
Approximations fail hardest:
- in the tails
- during volatility spikes

---

## Execution Reality
Where would approximation error appear in:
- volatility estimation?
- option pricing?
- leverage sizing?

---

## Decision
- Acceptable / Restricted / Reject

---

## Notes
Approximation without domain awareness is disguised negligence.

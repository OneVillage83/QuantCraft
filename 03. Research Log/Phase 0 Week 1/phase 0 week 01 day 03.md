# Phase 0 · Week 1 · Day 3
## Inequalities & Risk Intuition

### Objective
Understand how bounds protect against false confidence.

---

## Theory Focus
- Jensen’s inequality
- Cauchy–Schwarz
- Convexity intuition

---

## Key Concepts
- Nonlinearity punishes volatility
- Average inputs ≠ average outputs
- Risk hides in curvature

---

## Experiments
- Demonstrate volatility drag
- Compare arithmetic vs geometric returns

---

## Observations
- 
- 

---

## Failures Observed
- #risk
- 

---

## Risk Implications
Why volatility:
- lowers long-run growth
- invalidates naive Sharpe ratios

---

## Execution Reality
How volatility drag worsens under:
- leverage
- compounding
- drawdowns

---

## Decision
- Internalize / Revisit

---

## Notes
Markets punish variance, not just mean.

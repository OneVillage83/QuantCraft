# Phase 0 · Week 1 · Day 4
## Proof Literacy (Applied)

### Objective
Develop the ability to defend claims logically, not rhetorically.

---

## Theory Focus
- Proof by contradiction
- Proof by construction
- Counterexamples

---

## Key Concepts
- One counterexample kills a model
- Intuition must be defended
- “Seems to work” is not a proof

---

## Experiments
- Construct a case where:
  - an estimator fails
  - a backtest lies

---

## Observations
- 
- 

---

## Failures Observed
- #overfitting
- 

---

## Risk Implications
Why strategies fail silently before failing catastrophically.

---

## Execution Reality
How false proofs lead to:
- oversizing
- overconfidence
- delayed failure

---

## Decision
- Valid / Invalid / Inconclusive

---

## Notes
Markets do not accept hand-waving.

# Phase 0 · Week 1 · Day 5
## Numerical Stability in Practice

### Objective
Translate mathematical ideas into stable computation.

---

## Theory Focus
- Conditioning
- Stability vs correctness
- Algorithmic fragility

---

## Key Concepts
- Bad conditioning amplifies noise
- Stability beats precision
- Numerical bugs look like alpha

---

## Experiments
- Compare:
  - stable vs unstable algorithms
- Stress-test with random noise

---

## Observations
- 
- 

---

## Failures Observed
- #numerical
- 

---

## Risk Implications
Where numerical instability:
- mimics signal
- hides drawdown risk

---

## Execution Reality
Why live systems magnify instability.

---

## Decision
- Fix / Replace / Scrap

---

## Notes
Most quant blowups start as “minor numerical issues.”

# QuantCraft Vault

This vault is a personal, institutional-grade quant research system.

Goals:
- Build deep mathematical intuition
- Translate theory into executable systems
- Maintain auditability of decisions
- Integrate research directly into HoldIQ

Rules:
- No forward progress without understanding failure modes
- Every model must degrade gracefully
- Every week produces written artifacts
